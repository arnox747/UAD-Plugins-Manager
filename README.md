# UAD-Plugins-Manager
#### Manage Universal Audio plugins on a Mac / OSX


### The pain point
If like me, you're beyond tired of Universal Audio installing all of their plugins on every update, and than having a hard time finding the ones you actually own when using a DAW, this might be the solution to your pain. I've been meaning to write this utility for ages. It took a pandemic to finally make it happen.

**UAD Plugins Manager** requires basic knowledge of the Mac command line, because it runs in the Terminal, but it's intuitive and easy to use.

### How does it work?
**UAD Plugins Manager** simply moves UAD plugins in and out of the system folder; keeping the plugins you own in the system folder ('/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/[Components/ and vst/]'), and moving the ones you don't own into a 'managed_plugins/[Components/ and vst/]' sub folder. The plugins are moved, never copied or deleted, so nothing will be lost or compromised.

### Installation

Open a terminal window, and clone repo. At terminal prompt, type:

`cd ~`

`git clone https://github.com/arnox747/UAD-plugins-manager.git`

`cd UAD-plugins-manager`

*Finally, install the ruby gem tty-prompt:*

`gem install tty-prompt`

*if the above fails, you may need to run it as sudo:*
`sudo gem install tty-prompt`


### Running UAD Plugins Manager
At the terminal prompt, type `cd ~/UAD-plugins-manager` to go to the UAD Plugin Manager folder, then type:

`ruby manage_uad_plugins.rb` to start the app.

The main menu should appear, and hopefully requires no explanation:

If you chose the `â€£ Manage my UAD plugins` option, you'll be presented with a list of all of your UAD plugins, and an easy way to select the ones that you own (hit the SPACE BAR to toggle selection). You can use arrow up/down to move by one in either direction, or arrow left/right to go up and down by a page.

The plugins that you select here will be kept in the system folder. The ones that you don't select will be moved to the managed_plugins folder (component, vst, and vst mono). If you don't select any plugins, they will all be moved to the managed_plugins folder, and that's probably not what you want. That being said, even if you do make a mistake, you can just `Undo everything`.
